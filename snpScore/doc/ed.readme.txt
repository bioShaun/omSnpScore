1.CHROM : Chromosome
2.POS : Position
3.ALT : Alternative allele
4.wild.AF : wild bulk alternative allele frequency (the same as snp-index)
5.mutant.AF : mutant bulk alternative allele frequency (the same as snp-index)
6.AFD(deltaSNP) : Alternative allele frequency difference (mutant.AF - wild.AF)
7.REF_FRQ : total ref allele coverage of two bulk / total coverage (both refer and allele) of two bulk
8.wild.DP : wild bulk read coverage depth
9.mutant.DP : mutant bulk read coverage depth
10.ED : Euclidean distance at each SNP
11.fitted : ED^4 fit using a Loess curve
12.unfitted : ED^4
13.dis2edcutoff : cutoffs conservatively with a minimum distance of 0.5 and a minimum mutant pool allele frequency of 0.75.
